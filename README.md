# ` 1 ` **Why is Icey Music's audio sounding laggy/glitchy?**
No one likes laggy audio, but sometimes it happens when listening to bots on Discord. Here are some possible solutions on how to fix it.

## Icey Music is lagging, what should I do?
First, check your internet connection. Discord has an inbuilt way to monitor your last and average ping to their voice servers. In the bottom left corner, just click on "Voice Connected" and verify that your ping is behaving stably (if the red graph is stuttering a lot that means it's not stable!) and the last as well as the average ping are below 250 milliseconds. If any of these indicators show that your connection is bad you should check your Wi-Fi/LAN connection and make sure no other programs are using up bandwidth. Sometimes, restarting your router also gets rid of latency problems.

## You're on a 5ms ping and you can download GTA 5 in 2 minutes?
So your internet connection doesn't seem to be the problem. In almost all cases where Hydra is lagging, Discord is having temporary issues with their voice servers. Normally, Discord will just restart them at some point. But in the meantime, you can switch to a different server near you. In order to guarantee a smooth user experience

## First, open the settings page for your current voice channel

## Click on "Region Override" to open up a selection and select a different region

After following these steps you should finally have a lag-free audio stream again. If this is not the case, please [join our support server](https://discord.gg/WEDfTbFP3m) and check the `#status` channel for any ongoing incidents. If you can't find anything in there please get in contact with one of our support members.


# ` 2 ` **Why is Icey Music shown as offline in my server?**
This situation could occur in two different cases. Either we're rolling out an update to add new features or fix any bugs or either Discord, our hosting provider or one of us messed something up.

## So you've caught us having an outage?
That's mostly not the case, since we're rolling out updates in order to keep the bot fresh and smooth. We also like to add new features. Your best call would be to wait up to 5 minutes and see if Icey Music comes back online.

## Still offline?
If Icey Music seems to stay offline we'd appreciate if you would [join our support server](https://discord.gg/WEDfTbFP3m) and have a look at our `#status` channel. If there's no current incident going on please report the issue you're having. We'll be able to look into that and help you as fast as possible.

# ` 3 ` **Why is Icey Music not responding to my messages?**
You're trying to command Icey Music to play a song but it doesn't want to listen? Well, it's probably not able to answer, but follow the steps below to fix this.

## Am I even using the correct prefix?
Make sure you're using the right prefix (either `-` for the default one or any custom one that you set by yourself)! To find out to what prefix Icey Music is currently listening to you can simply mention Icey Music like `@Icey Music` and it'll respond with the current set prefix.

# ` 4 ` **Why can't I hear Icey Music playing audio?**
It might happen that Icey Music does not transmit any audio, but that's mostly an issue on your side. We'll guide you through some steps that should help you to resolve such an issue.

## You can't hear anything.
If there's a global issue with transmitting audio in your voice channel you should first check if you can hear any sounds from your operating system in general. If that seems to not be the case you should first resolve any issues with your audio equipment or settings in your operating system. Googling mostly helps here.

If you're very well able to receive sounds in general you can go ahead and check if Discord is the affected component. In order to resolve that you should verify your `Voice & Video` settings. Specify the correct input and output devices and also test your microphone inside Discord.

## Discord and your operating system are working fine.
If you're able to hear others in your voice channel neither of the two should be the cause of this issue. In that case you can go ahead and check several things.

Does Icey Music have the permission to speak? Resolving permission issues can sometimes help fixing the underlying issue.

Is Icey Music muted/server muted? It sometimes happens that either you forgot to unmute Icey Music or someone is trying to make a joke out of you. In that case you should definitely be sure that Icey Music is not muted in any way.

If Icey Music is not muted you should also check if your volume slider is moved down to 0%. If Icey Music is quite loud you'd want it somewhere between 3% and 10%, but 0% just resolves into no audio at all.

## Is there something funky going on?
You followed all of the above steps but you still can't hear Icey Music? Try switching your server region in order to get a new and fresh Discord voice server. If this still resolves into no audio feel free to [join our support server](https://discord.gg/WEDfTbFP3m) and report your issue.
